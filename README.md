# SelfCheckOut-software

## Overview
**SelfCheckOut-software** is a self-checkout software system designed in Java using the Observer design pattern and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts. This project aims to facilitate efficient interaction between software and simulated hardware components, providing a robust platform for self-checkout operations.

## Features
- Implementation of the Observer design pattern for efficient event handling.
- Simulated hardware components for a realistic self-checkout experience.
- Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure maintainability and scalability.
- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SelfCheckOut-software.git
    ```
2. **Open the project in your IDE:**
    - Open your preferred IDE.
    - Import the cloned repository as a new project.

3. **Build the project:**
    - Use your IDE's build tools to compile the project. Typically, this can be done with a `Build` or `Make` command.

4. **Run the application:**
    - Locate the main class (usually `Main.java` or a class with a `main` method).
    - Run the main class to start the self-checkout software.

## Usage
The **SelfCheckOut-software** provides a simulation environment for a self-checkout system. Users can interact with various simulated hardware components such as barcode scanners, payment terminals, and receipt printers through the software interface.

## Design Patterns
This project heavily utilizes the Observer design pattern to manage the interaction between different components efficiently. Observers are notified of changes in state, ensuring a responsive and modular design.
